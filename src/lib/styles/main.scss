/**
This is a global SCSS stylesheet. 

âœ‹ BEFORE YOU USE THIS...
Remember, it's better to write styles in your components so they'll be safely scoped to
just the elements you mean to style.

This stylesheet *is* a good place *if* you're writing styles that will be shared across several components.

You can import and use this stylesheet in your Svelte components like this:

<style lang="scss">
  :global{
    @import './styles/main.scss';
  }
</style>
**/
